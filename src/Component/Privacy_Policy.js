        We will delete personal data from our systems if we have not had any

        as we believe, in good faith, that the law or relevant regulators

        data will no longer be relevant for the purposes for which it was
        collected. We will consider there to be meaningful contact with you if
        you submit any correspondence via our website, apply for jobs with us or
        we receive a CV from a job board. We will also consider it a meaningful
        contact if you communicate with us about potential roles, either by
        verbal or written communication or engage with any of our marketing
        communications. Under new data protection regulations (GDPR), we are
        required to keep the data we hold accurate and, where necessary, up to
        date. As such, we will make an effort to regularly communicate with you
        to ensure your data is up to date and accurate. Whilst we will endeavour
        to permanently erase your personal data once it reaches the end of its
        retention period or where we receive a valid request from you to do so,
        some of your data may still exist within an archive system. While
        certain details may still exist on an archive system, this cannot be
        readily accessed by any of our operational systems, processes, or staff.
